# Project for CMake testing in Urho3D


## 1 Build on Windows

### 1.1 Prepare projects
* Clone official Urho3D project under the same parent directory. You should see `Urho3DCMakeTest` and `Urho3D` are in the same folder.

### 1.2 Build Urho3D project
* In the Urho3D directory, generate Visual Studio solution of Urho3D with command line like `script\cmake_vs2019.bat BUILD_vs2019 -DURHO3D_64BIT=1 -DURHO3D_LUA=0 -DURHO3D_D3D11=1`.
* Open generated Visual Studio solution in BUILD_vs2019 and build Urho3D.

### 1.3 Build Urho3DCMakeTest project
* Set `URHO3D_HOME` environment variable to the path of folder `BUILD_vs2019` of Urho3D
* `mkdir BUILD_vs2019` inside Urho3DCMakeTest.
* Generate the project with CMake using commandline like `cd BUILD_vs2019` and `cmake ..`
* Now you can see the Visual Studio solution is in BUILD_vs2019. You can build it with Visual Studio and run the sample.


## 2 Cross compiling Android app on Windows
Just like Urho3D, Gradle is used to build android application. Everything android related is put into `android` directory. Android SDK, Anroid NDK, MinGW and stuff are needed as dependencies on Windows. 
* Open `cmd` and `cd android` folder.
* Executing `gradlew.bat build` or `gradlew.bat build --parallel` will build APK for you.
* Known issue - `Data`, `CoreData` etc. folders should be copied manually to `launcher-app/src/main/assets` directory.
* If everything is correct, APKs can be found at `android/launcher-app/build/outputs/apk/`
